<h1>About</h1>

Your delta time simulator is an open source project designed for beginner and advanced Unity developers who want to gain a deeper understanding of time.deltaTime and time.fixedDeltaTime. The simulator provides a visual demonstration of the update and fixed update loops, allowing users to compare the speed of objects under different conditions such as high or low FPS or with a fixed time step.

The simulator is built with user-friendliness in mind, making it easy for anyone to get started with. The interface is intuitive and straightforward, allowing users to quickly experiment with different settings and observe the results in real-time.

One of the key features of the simulator is its ability to showcase the impact of different time-related variables on the behavior of objects in a Unity scene. By adjusting the time step or FPS, users can see firsthand how changes in these values affect the smoothness and consistency of object movement.

Whether you're a beginner looking to learn more about Unity's time-related functions, or an experienced developer seeking to fine-tune your game's performance, the delta time simulator is a valuable resource that can help you gain a deeper understanding of this critical aspect of game development.
